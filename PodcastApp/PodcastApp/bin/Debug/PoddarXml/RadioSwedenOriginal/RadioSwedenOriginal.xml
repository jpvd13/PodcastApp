Italian and Polish translators head to the Gothenburg Book Fair. Hear what's being done to keep abandoned boats from polluting the water. <br/><br/> Parliament opened this week, but who's going to govern in a situation that's been called "locked"? Today, the speaker of Parliament, Andreas Norlén, who's already warned that he's not a wizard - started the task of trying to figure that out, by making his first so-called speaker-round. We speak to Professor Li Bennich-Björkman, a political scientist at Uppsala University, for analysis of the "polarized" political scene.
About three dozen translators and publishers from all over the world have received funding to attend Scandinavia's biggest book fair in Gothenburg, in an effort to increase the chances that people who speak other languages will be able to read books by Swedish authors. We hear from attendees, including Italian translator Laura Cangemi, children's book editor Stefania di Mella who works at a publishing company in Milan, and Polish translator Maciej Liguziski, who's just starting out in the business after five years studying Swedish literature and language in Pozna, Poland.
And finally, Sweden is a major boating nation, with around 900,000 leisure boats! That's more per capita than almost any other country in the world, but a sizeable number of these boats have reached a ripe old age and getting rid of them without polluting the water is proving a major headache. Two people helping out in the effort to get people to scrap their boats in a sustainable way are Josefin Arrhenborg and Maria Rindstam, and they talk about what made them change their ways.

We find out why the Swedish Nature Conservation Society is encouraging people to build their own bee hotels.
And finally, we talk to Malmö social entrepreneur Christian Glasnovic about why he's trying to set up Malmedalen, a Malmö version of the giant Swedish political festival Almedalen, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.

We preview the Peter Madsen murder trial which began in Copenhagen, Thursday. He's accused of murdering and dismembering the body of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who had gone onto the Dane's submarine to write a story about him.
We speak to Ingrid Wall about the memorial fund that she has set up in memory of her daughter, to support young female journalists in their work.
And on International Women's Day, efforts by the government to increase the number of articles about women on Wikipedia have not been welcomed by all.

We speak to its chancellor Kerstin Tham, and to employment minister Ylva Johansson about why education is so important for getting new arrivals to Sweden into work.  
Backed by an injection of central government money, Malmös authorities are cracking down on the citys sheesha clubs where people, mostly immigrants, go to smoke tobacco from water pipes. But how do those who frequent these clubs feel about the onslaught on their favourite vice? Radio Sweden visits a club and meets Jonatan Örstrand from the Malmö Police.
In February, a man was shot dead in the early evening hours on the corner of the Möllevång square in central Malmö. So why is David Polfeldt, chief executive of  the computer game company Massive Entertainment, moving his offices there?
And finally, can music help immigrants feel at home? Iraq-born musician Ali Sabah thinks so. He has set the songs of Evert Taube, one of Sweden's most-beloved balladeers, to the oud, which is a type of Arabic lute.

We speak to its chancellor Kerstin Tham, and to employment minister Ylva Johansson about why education is so important for getting new arrivals to Sweden into work.  
Backed by an injection of central government money, Malmös authorities are cracking down on the citys sheesha clubs where people, mostly immigrants, go to smoke tobacco from water pipes. But how do those who frequent these clubs feel about the onslaught on their favourite vice? Radio Sweden visits a club and meets Jonatan Örstrand from the Malmö Police.

Meanwhile, Sweden's Official Council of Jewish Communities has appealed the Gothenburg police's decision to allow the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement to march near the local synagogue on September 30th, which is also the high Jewish high holiday of Yom Kippur.

Starting April, single Swedish women will be able to access state-funded fertility treatments on the same terms as heterosexual and same-sex couples. That's thanks to a legal amendment that was passed by parliament earlier this month. So women can now become single mothers with a little help from the public-health system.But there's already a shortage in sperm, with too few men stepping forward to meet the demands of couples who need help getting pregnant. With at least 2,000 singles expected to seek fertility treatment in the next year, clinics are trying to recruit new donors. Radio Sweden has visited one of those clinics, run by associate professor Kjell Wånggren.But what are the incentives to donating sperm anyway? And if women no longer need partners to get pregnant, does that mean men are obsolete? Historian Lars Trägårdh puts the whole issue of single parenthood in perspective - and considers what it might mean for men in the future.We also speak to members of two of the organisations that have been at the forefront of the fight to extend fertility treatments to singles: the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) and Femmis, a network for single-mums-by-choice. They describe the move as "a victory for single women" and as an important signal that society is beginning to accept all kinds of families.Not everyone agrees, though.

Historian Lars Trägårdh puts the whole issue of single parenthood in perspective - and considers what it might mean for men in the future.We also speak to members of two of the organisations that have been at the forefront of the fight to extend fertility treatments to singles: the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) and Femmis, a network for single-mums-by-choice. They describe the move as "a victory for single women" and as an important signal that society is beginning to accept all kinds of families.Not everyone agrees, though. We hear a dissenting view, from Emma Henriksson, deputy leader of the Christian Democrat Party, which opposed the new law, arguing it goes against the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.Producer: Nathalie Rothschild ]]></itunes:summary><itunes:author>Sveriges Radio</itunes:author><itunes:keywords><![CDATA[Radio,Sweden,Reproductive,rights,and,the,future,of,men]]></itunes:keywords><itunes:image href="https://static-cdn.sr.se/sida/images/2054/3637482_3246_1828.jpg?preset=api-itunes-presentation-image" /><itunes:duration>00:29:11</itunes:duration><itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[As single women get the right to access fertility treatment in Sweden, what does it mean for the future of families - and of men?]]></itunes:subtitle><enclosure url="https://sverigesradio.se/topsy/ljudfil/podrss/5595743.mp3" length="28028372" type="audio/mpeg" /></item><item><title><![CDATA[Refugee for hire: How newcomers build (or rebuild) careers]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's tough to get your first job in Sweden.

Thirteen alone took place last month in October.In many of the cases, police suspect the flames were started deliberately. So far no one's been arrested. But ever since the arson attacks picked up pace in mid-October, security has been a top concern for the authorities. After a fire in Danderyd and another arson attack at a planned refugee center in southern Sweden, the Swedish Migration Agency decided that it was no longer safe to have a public list of addresses of its planned and established refugee housing. The agency is also placing stricter rules on visits to places where asylum seekers are living.

Thirteen alone took place last month in October.In many of the cases, police suspect the flames were started deliberately. So far no one's been arrested. But ever since the arson attacks picked up pace in mid-October, security has been a top concern for the authorities.
